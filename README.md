# XAI-in-Obj-detection
The project is based on implementing appropriate eXplainable AI models for object detection in self driving cars. Typically any self driving car has to detect an object to take actions based on it. XAI model implemented over it helps us to evaluate the model prediction. I used faster_RCNN embedded over RESNET50 as my object detection model.
